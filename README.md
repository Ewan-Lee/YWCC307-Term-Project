Team project 5 repository.

Your team is involved in designing a new crypto currency for a sovereign client.
You have been asked to evaluate various crypto platforms for the basis of your
currency.

As a substitute fiat currency, the government is mindful of certain processes and
regulations that should be supported and continue to operate flawlessly with the
new crypt currency regime as well. These include Anti-Money Laundering (AML),
know your customer (KYC), and Fraud detection.

What does your team think and would suggest as your teamâ€™s platform of choice to
your client?
